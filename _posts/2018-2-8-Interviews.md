## Attending my first two interviews
So yesterday I attended my first two interviews! The first was a software developer position at Rogue Wave Software. It was a webcam
interview. The next was a mobile quality assurance position at Star Technologies. It was a phone interview.

# Rogue Wave Software
I think that my interview at Rogue Wave Software went pretty well. It was mostly just questions about projects that I had worked on.
Other than that I think that I would really like to work for this company. The product that they work on seems really interesting
and the culture there feels like a perfect fit!

# Star Technologies
The interview at Star Technologies was basically like a conversation. That's pretty much all I can say about it since it felt
so smooth and natural. I would also like to work for this company but I think that Rogue Wave Software would be my top choice.
