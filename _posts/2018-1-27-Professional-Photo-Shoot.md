title: A professional photo shoot?
---

This Friday, I had the opportunity to get a professional photo shoot because of a report that the school was doing 
for the donor of the Adel Sedra Smith Entrance Scholarship. It was a really cool experience, one that I've never had 
before. Bascially, the entire shoot consisted of us going to different places on campus and the photographer posing me
so that he could be some good shots. It was kinda different from regular photoshoots since the photographer didn't pose
me, but instead just asked me to pretend that I was just having a conversation with him. It made the entire experience so
much easier and feel better. If you ever get the opportunity to get a professional photo shoot, I would definitely recommend
that you take it!
