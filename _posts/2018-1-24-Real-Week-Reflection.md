title: The week where everything became real
---

This is going to be the real reflect of the week where ECE 1B became 1B ECE.

Last week was probably one of the most stressful and interesting weeks of my Waterloo ECE career so far. So, to recap, Waterloo Work's main round opened, every course started picking up speed and it rained a lot :(

## Waterloo Works
The main for Waterloo Works opened up which means that all the main jobs opened up. It was pretty crazy seeing all of the jobs that I could apply to! There were over 2300 jobs that were targeted to my cluster (which means that my program, ECE, was one of the programs that the job looked to hire from). A good part of the week was spent on just going through all the jobs and choosing which ones interested me. Of course, there were giant companies like Apple and Google (<-- I applied to this one :D), but there were also cool smaller companies that interested me such as Kinaxis and Trend Micro. After going through over 800 of the jobs, I finally decided on the 50 that I was going to apply to. Then I went through the five resumes that I had made, each target to a different type of 'tech' job and picked the perfect on for the job
* Software
* Embedded
* Mobile
* Web + Android
* Web + iOS

Some jobs also required a cover letter so writting those too up some time too. One that I wanted in particular, Relic Entertainment required a cover letter so I hope mine gets me an interview :/
Its also a pretty nerve racking process since you get to see how many other people applied to the same jobs that you did. Most of the jobs had 30-50 applicants per job spot so my confidence definately isn't very high so far.

## School so far
ECE 106 has been picking up in speed this past week. We went from simple-ish electric fields to Gauss law, which while is a simple concept requires some thinking to apply. ECE 140 has also been getting harder since we have learned all the basic concepts like Ohm's Law, KVL and KCL and now we are learning more ways to solve circuits such as Nodal and Mesh Analysis. Overall, everything has just been getting faster and theres now harder assignments and labs.

## The weather
Now I finally understand when people complain about Waterloo's weather. Its snowed, and rained continually throughout. I don't think I've seen the sun out this week yet :( Also, when it rains, it doesn't stay warm so the rain freezes and everything become really slippery. Kinda sucked having to walk to school when its really slippery. Would not recommend it. 

Overall, this semester has been quite a bit harder that 1A. I think its a combination of every course not being review but something new, the job application process and the overall terrible weather. Heres to hoping that I survive this semester intact!
