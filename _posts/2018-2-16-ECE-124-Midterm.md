title: ECE 124 Midterm
---

This midterm was probably the one that I felt best after. Even though it was really long and somewhat difficult, I think that
I got most of the concepts pretty well. Even though this week has been pretty bad, it's finally reading week which means
I can relax! Now I just gotta prepare for my interviews.
