## Midterms
Next week is going to be midterm week, also known as Hell Week. Here's my feeling on each of the courses:

# MATH 119
This is the midterm that I feel most confident about. I feel that I have all the concepts down pretty well. The only thing that I 
am worried about is the timing of the exam and if I would be able to finish it in time. Overall I feel I will do well on this midterm.

# ECE 106
I'm not really sure what to think of this midterm. Even the concepts are fairly easy to understand, it's going to be a lot about how 
I apply the concepts. From what I've had during the weekly quizes at tutorial, I feel that this is going to be to toss-up on how I do.

# ECE 140
For this midterm, I'm not really worried since I feel most of it is pretty basic. Same as the MATH 119 midterm, I feel like I will do 
well on it.

# ECE 108
I honestly don't know what to think of this midterm. I have absolutely no idea what is going in class, and I feel that most the class also
shares the same feelings that I have. The material is closely following the textbook so I guess I'll be cramming that the night before.

# ECE 124
This is the midterm that I'm most worried about. Even the ideas and concepts are very easy to understand, the application is going to be
very difficult. I feel the key to doing well on this exam is to just rush through the easy (knowledge) questions to maximize the 
time that I have with the questions where I have to apply my knowledge.
