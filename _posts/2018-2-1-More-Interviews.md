title: More Interviews?
---

## Wait I got more interivews?
Thats right, I got two more interviews today! One is a QA (Quality Assurance) position for Star Technologies.The other is an IT and QA 
position for the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission). I actually kinda screwed up with the TTC because I didn't realize that it was a posting
for 8 months instead of 4 but I went to my academic advisor and got it sorted out. If I do recieve the job then I would be able to 
submit a stream change form and take the job! That was a big relief since dealing with CECA would have been a nightmare in combination
with school (midterms) and potentially get banned from Waterloo Works for two terms.
