title: Applying to Co-ops
---
This entire week has been an adventure. Waterloo works opened up and the first round started! Its pretty cool to see all the
jobs but also pretty demoralizing seeing how all the jobs I've applied to were also getting tons of applications too. 
This is going to be pretty short since I have quite a bit of work to do but I can't wait to see if I get any interviews.
