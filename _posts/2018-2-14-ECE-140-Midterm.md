title: ECE 140 Midterm
---

There seems to be a common theme with midterms this semester. It just feels like each is more difficult than the last and I just
end up feeling worse and worse after each one. This midterm was OK-ish, nothing that we've never seen, but it didn't feel good.
The mesh analysis question was a cluster of a mess but the tricks in this midterm that were required in every past midterm so
I guess it was fair? Anyways, my next midterm (ECE 108) is going to very interesting since I actually have no idea what is happening 
right now in the course. Did I also mention that I have interview too? Can't wait.
