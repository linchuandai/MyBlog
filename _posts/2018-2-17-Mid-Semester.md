title: Mid Semester Reflection
---

It is finally reading week which means that I survived hell well and am done half of the semester. Here's my reflection on the semester.

# Co-op Job Searching
Well job searching has been a very interesting experience. On one hand, I think that I went a little overboard on the application to jobs
part, applying to 101 job postings. On the other hand, I've been really happy with the interviews that I've gotten. As of now, I've
recieved 6 interviews:

* Software Developer at Rogue Wave Software
* Quality Assurance Analyst at Star Technologies
* Test Analyst at TTC
* Web + Technologies Developer at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research
* iOS Developer for XE.com
* Payments Innovation Developer at TD

Honestly, I would be very happy with any of these jobs. Fingers crossed that I actually get one of them!

# Courses so far
So I don't think that my semester academically has been going very well. Each midterm just felt worse than the last. I'm pretty sure
I can pass this semester, but I just don't know how high my marks are going to be. :/ I just have to keep on studying and doing the 
assignments and make sure I understand the concepts. As for the difficulty of these courses, I would rank them as:
ECE106 > ECE108 > ECE124 > ECE140 > MATH119
This is just my opinion of the difficulty of the courses so YMMV.


# Overall Reflection
I think that this semester has been going pretty well. It's definitely a huge jump from last term (1A) since I didn't have to apply
to jobs and worry about the whole co-op process, and I can see my marks taking a hit because of that. I can't wait to finally finish 
this semester and move onto my first job (if I get one) !
