title: The first day of classes
---
Today was an exciting day since it was the first day of class. I can't believe I survived 1A and am now miving on to 1B. Its going to get a lot more challenging from here on. 
While I was pretty happy about my performance in 1A, there is still a lot I need to work on.
Some goals I have for 1B
* Get above an 80% average and pass all my courses (looking at you ECE 106)
* Find a co-op job
* Don't screw up ACE A Capella (as co-president)

I can't wait to see what the rest of the semester brings!
