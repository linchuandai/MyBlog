title: My First Interview!

## First Interview?
Today I finally got my first interview! Its for a software developer role for a company called Rogue Wave Software. They role that
I'm interviewing for will be their static program analysis product called Klocwork. I'm really excited about this but also really 
nervous. I'm going to have to brush up on my Java, C++ and OOP knowledge. Oh yeah, did I mention that this job is going to be in Ottawa?
I've always wanted to visit Ottawa which makes this job so much better.

## How I'm preparing for the interview.
First, I'm going to brush up on the basic concepts of C++ and Java. This means all the basic syntax and little quirks of the language. 
Next, I'm going to go over the concepts of OOP or Object Orientated Programming. Things like polymorphism and hierarchy. Finally, I'll
start working on programming challenges in the C++ and Java. Some of these challenges include the Fizz-Buzz challenge, which is a really
common programming challenge given out during interviews. 

Then, I'll do some research on the company, its values and the actual product I will be working on. One I gain a good enough understanding 
of the company I'll prepare some questions for the interviewer at the end of the interview. Hopefully I'll do well!
