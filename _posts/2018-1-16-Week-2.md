title: Week 2 - Getting into the groove of the semester
---
Now that its week 2, I've slowly gotten back into the school mindset. (That means sleep at 1 am and waking up at 7am :( and doing homework)
That one thing that I really enjoy about ECE this semester is the labs for each course. I just went to my ECE 140 Circuits and and I
had a blast. It was pretty cool building the actual circuit and seeing the light bulb light up. Also, when your circuit didn't, I would
have to trace through the circuit and try to find where I had a mistake. That was pretty fun too since the bulb immediately lit up
when I made those corrections.

Anther big thing thats been going on is job searching. Waterloo works just opened up and it has been a hassle trying to get my resume
finished and tailored to each job and finding the jobs that I want to apply to. Of course Cali or Bust has passed my mind but I think I'd 
like to get a job this term :) It's actually pretty exciting seeing alls these jobs that are open and that you can apply to but its also
pretty demoralizing when you see a job with 2 opennings but 30 applicants. Can't wait till interviews come out. Hopefully i'll get some.

School and A Capella and Waterloo Works have taken up so much of my time i'm pretty sure I have negative time. O well :/ Such is Waterloo
