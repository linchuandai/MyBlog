title: Week 1 Reflections
---
Well, its been a whole week since school has started and it has been a blast! Now I'm finally learning about subjects 
that actually pertain to my major such as ECE106 (Electricity and Magnetism) and ECE124 (Digital Computers and Circuits). 
Also this week was my firstACE rehearsal as President!

1B ECE has definitely been harder since everything is new and not high school review. This doesn't mean that it's not fun 
though. Some of my favourite classes have been:
*ECE124 - Digit Computers and Systems
  *Learned about boolean algebra (cool!)
  *Labs where we work with FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) to make custom circuits using VHDL
*ECE140 - Linear Circuits
  *Basically ECE in a nutshell :)

My first rehearsal as president was really awesome. It was great to see all the new people that came out to A Capella for
the first time, and all the old returning members too. The best part was listening at the end after sectionals when they
put all the stuff they rehearsed together. I was blown away at how good they sounded. I can't wait for next week's rehearsal.

Even though school has become busier with more work and assignments, I'll try to keep this blog updated once per week.
See you next week :)
