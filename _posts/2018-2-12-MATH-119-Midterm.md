title: MATH 119 Midterm
---

That MATH 119 midterm was something... 
It was definitely the longest and hardest midterm that I've had (so far, * 106 :( * ) I feel that even though most of the questions
were "fair" there was definitely a fair bit more thinking that was required. I think I could have definitely prepared for it better.
My only grip with it was that it was really long. I barely had enough time to even finish it and was actually rushing to finish it 
near the end. Here's hope to there being an easier final.
